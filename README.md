## micropython-captive-portal-network-setup
A MicroPython Captive Portal for Setting Network Options on the Fly

## Notes
This code is **heavily** based on the work done by Amora Labs. See their code [here](https://github.com/amora-labs/micropython-captive-portal).

This code allows a user to connect to the NodeMCU's WiFi, navigate to ```192.168.4.1``` and set the network name and password. A walk through and more details are available on [my blog](http://blog.brockman.io/?p=54).
